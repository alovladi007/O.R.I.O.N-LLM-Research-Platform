# Instructions to Push ORION Platform to GitHub

The complete ORION platform has been created and committed locally. To push it to GitHub, follow these steps:

## 1. Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name it: `ORION-LLM-Research-Platform-Enhanced` (or your preferred name)
3. Make it public or private as desired
4. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

## 2. Add Remote and Push

After creating the empty repository, run these commands in the `/workspace/orion-platform` directory:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ORION-LLM-Research-Platform-Enhanced.git

# Rename branch to main (GitHub's default)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If you're using SSH instead of HTTPS:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/ORION-LLM-Research-Platform-Enhanced.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. What's Been Created

All files have been committed locally with the message:
"Initial commit: Complete ORION platform with all advanced features"

This includes:
- Complete source code structure in `src/`
- Configuration files
- Docker setup
- Documentation
- Examples
- All advanced features from the original implementation

## 5. Next Steps After Pushing

1. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
2. Configure branch protection rules
3. Add collaborators if needed
4. Set up GitHub Pages for documentation
5. Create releases/tags for version management
